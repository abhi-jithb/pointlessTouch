# Absolutely Pointless Button üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Individual
## Team Members : Abhijith B


### Project Description
A delightfully useless web application featuring a button that explicitly warns users not to press it, only to display a cheeky message when they inevitably do.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where every button serves a purpose, we asked: what if we created a button that serves absolutely no purpose at all? The existential crisis of having too many functional buttons needed to be addressed.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a button that begs users not to press it, creating the perfect paradox of human curiosity. When pressed, it simply confirms what we already knew - users can't resist a button that says "Do Not Press!"
